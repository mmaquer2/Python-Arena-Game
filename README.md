- This served as a final Project for CS5150 (Game AI) at Northeastern University Spring 2022

## Description: 
- This is a 2d arena fighting game with action rpg mechanics. The game contains 3 NPC characters and one human player. Each is randomly assigned a weapon and stats, and is placed in the map all to fight each other until a single victor emerges.

- **Note** this program will only work on a windows system due to file path constraints, I have not yet transferred the code to a common fil epath system
