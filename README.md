# Game AI:

- prcoedurally created behavior trees: 


- pathfinding: The pathfinding is done by the A* library provided by 


## items and stats:

# Setup and Settings
- Download the source directory onto your machine 
- Ensure python 3.0x in installed on your machine 
- To change game window dimensions update the window height and width variable in settings.py
- Navigate to the src directory and run the game.py file or with your cli




## Usage

```bash

# ensure python 3.0x is installed on your machine
python -v

# install the pygame framework with pip
