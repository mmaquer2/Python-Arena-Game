# Python-Arena-Game
- This served as a final Project for CS5150 (Game AI) at Northeastern University Spring 2022

## Description: 
- This is a 2d arena fighting game with action rpg mechanics. The game contains 3 NPC characters and one human player. Each is given a randomly selected assorted of items, stats, and is placed in the map to fight each other until a single victor emerges.

- start points, 


# Game AI:

- Prcoedurally created behavior trees: 


- Pathfinding: The pathfinding is done by the A* library provided by 


## items and stats:
 - baseline stats, health, energy, strength, 

# Setup and Settings
- Download the source directory onto your machine 
- Ensure python 3.0x in installed on your machine 
- To change game window dimensions update the window height and width variable in settings.py

# then verify it was intalled correctly
pygame -v

# With your cli of choice navigate to the src directory and run the following command to start the game
