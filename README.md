# Python-Arena-Game
- This served as a final Project for CS5150 (Game AI) at Northeastern University Spring 2022

## Description: 
- This is a 2d arena fighting game with action rpg mechanics. The game may contain up to four characters in which each player is given a randomly selected assorted of items, stats, and is placed in the map. 

- The NPC's behaivors and items are determined by procedurally generated behavior trees. So with each playthrough an the players are required to adapt to a different set of items issued to them and adapt the the map created.d


# Game AI:

- Prcoedurally created behavior trees: 


- Pathfinding: The pathfinding is done by the A* library provided by 


## items and stats:
 - baseline stats, health, energy, strength, 

# Setup and Settings
- Download the source directory onto your machine 
- Ensure python 3.0x in installed on your machine 
- To change game window dimensions update the window height and width variable in settings.py
- Navigate to the src directory and run the game.py file or with your cli




## Usage

```bash

# ensure python 3.0x is installed on your machine
python -v

# install the pygame framework with pip
pip install pygame

# with your cli of choice navigate to the src directory and run the following command

python 3 game.py run()

#run the program from the game.py file, when prompted enter the number of players and the in the game round 2 -4, the screen will then load for you to play the game

```
